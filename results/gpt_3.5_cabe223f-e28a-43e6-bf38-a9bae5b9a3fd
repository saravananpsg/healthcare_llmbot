{"user_query": "What are the recommended exercises for diabetic person ?", "answer": "The recommended exercises for a person with diabetes include a combination of aerobic exercises, strength training, and flexibility exercises. Aerobic exercises such as brisk walking, cycling, swimming, or jogging help improve cardiovascular health, control weight, and enhance insulin sensitivity. Strength training exercises, like lifting weights or using resistance bands, can help build muscle mass and improve overall metabolism. Flexibility exercises, such as yoga or stretching, can improve mobility and reduce the risk of injuries. It is important for individuals with diabetes to engage in physical activities that they enjoy and can sustain in the long term to reap the benefits of regular exercise.", "source_docs": [{"source_doc": "A 5-7% weight loss is recommended to prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes.\u200b\n\nA \u2265 5% weight loss improves glucose, lipids and blood pressure control\u200b\n\n75\n\nTypes of interventions and expected weight loss\n\nType of intervention\u200b\n\nExpected weight loss\u200b\n\nExercise only*\n\n0 to 3%\u200b\n\nDiet + exercise\u200b\n\n3 to 10%\u200b\n\nWeight loss medications,\u200b very low calorie diet\u200b\n\n5 to 10%\u200b\n\nEndoscopic bariatric procedures\u200b\n\n15 to 20%\u200b\n\nBariatric surgery\u200b\n\n25 to 30%\u200b\n\n(SGH Obesity Centre; Swift et al., 2018*)\u200b\n\n76\n\nGeneral considerations for individuals with obesity Lower physical activity levels are prevalent in adults who are overweight and obese This is likely due to low exercise capacity and being easily fatigued\u200b\n\nModifications:\u200b\n\nStart slow E.g., If you are starting a walking programme, start with leisure walking instead of brisk walking.\n\nTake breaks in between E.g., Instead of doing 20 mins of physical activity continuously, aim for 2 x 10 mins with a break in between.\n\nProgress gradually Monitor your overall energy and fatigue levels during and the day after exercise.\u200b Ensure that you do not feel excessively fatigued, such that you can't carry out your normal daily routine.\n\n(Source: Cassidy et al., 2017)\n\n77\n\nFor individuals with coronary heart disease\n\n78\n\nBenefits of being physically active for individuals with Diabetes and Coronary Heart Disease\n\nExercising and participating in physical activity:\n\nImproves glucose utilisation and insulin sensitivity\u200b \u2022 Controls weight \u200b \u2022 Improves fitness\u200b \u2022 Reduces your risk of a cardiac event\u200b \u2022 Increases your chances of surviving a cardiac event\n\nImpaired glucose control and being sedentary are major risk factors of coronary heart disease.

{"answer": "Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It is characterized by high blood sugar levels that can pose risks to both the mother and the baby. Gestational diabetes is usually diagnosed through screening tests during pregnancy. According to the articles provided, the diagnosis of gestational diabetes involves screening all women at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation using a 3-point 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Additionally, women at increased risk of pre-existing diabetes are recommended to be screened for diabetes during their first trimester using non-pregnancy glucose thresholds. If the results are normal, these women should be re-evaluated for gestational diabetes at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.", "source_docs": [{"source_doc": "GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; IADPSG, International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test *All values in mmol/L.\n\n3\n\nAvoiding HbA1c for screening and diagnosis of diabetes during pregnancy\n\nGlycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) should not be used to screen for or diagnose diabetes during pregnancy.

Screening for diabetes during pregnancy with HbA1c has also not been validated locally.\n\nPost-pregnancy\n\nFollow up women with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy\n\nUsually, plasma glucose reverts to pre-pregnancy levels six weeks after delivery.

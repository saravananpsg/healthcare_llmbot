Healthy Eating When You Have Diabetes

Diet is an important part of diabetes management. Eating well not only helps with your diabetes control, but also with weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and general health.

Healthy eating is recommended for everyone, including individuals with diabetes. All individuals can enjoy the same healthy meals.

Read on for a general guide on how you can make healthy food choices and have a balanced diet. For nutritional advice personalised to your condition and needs, do speak to a healthcare professional such as a dietitian.

While protein and fat may not have a direct impact on blood sugar levels, eating too much protein and fat can lead to weight gain which will increase insulin resistance and make diabetes control more difficult.

The type and amount of fat consumed is important. Mono- and poly- unsaturated fats are better for you. We should limit our intake of saturated and trans fats (e.g., found in fried chicken and baked products) to reduce our risk of cardiovascular disease.",https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/70e56617c5b140139bb5cb37db3cdef0?v=a7dd48f7&_gl=1*11zfakr*_ga*MTk3Mjg0Mjc5Ni4xNzA3Nzg5OTUw*_ga_VQW1KL2RMR*MTcxMDc1MzAxMS40LjEuMTcxMDc1NDQzMC42MC4wLjA.,0.894188722,"Some healthy eating tips for people with diabetes include:
1. Focusing on a balanced diet that includes whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables.
2. Limiting the intake of saturated and trans fats to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
3. Choosing healthier cooking methods like steaming, baking, boiling, or grilling.
4. Using natural seasonings instead of salt and opting for healthier cooking oils like sunflower, olive, or canola.
5. Planning meals that incorporate vegetables as the main dish and making them 50% of your plate.
6. Opting for healthier ingredients and whole grains over refined grains.
7. Removing visible fat from meat before cooking.
8. Consulting with a healthcare professional, such as a dietitian, for personalized nutritional advice tailored to your condition and needs."
,"If your schedule does not allow you to take regular meals, do discuss with your healthcare team on a diabetic medication regimen that is more suited for your lifestyle.

If you are planning to substantially reduce the amount of carbohydrates in your meals, you may be at risk of hypoglycaemia if you are on insulin or certain oral medications (sulfonylureas such as glipizide, gliclazide, glimepiride, tolbutamide). Do discuss with your doctor on how your medication can be adjusted to match any change in your diet. 22

You can whip up delicious and healthy meals even if you have diabetes. Some tips on how you can do this:

Use healthier cooking methods (e.g., steaming, baking, boiling, grilling).

Use healthier ingredients

Choose wholegrains instead of refined grains. For example, replace white rice with brown rice

Choose lean meat and remove all visible fat before cooking

Reduce salt, instead use natural seasoning (e.g., herbs and spices) Use condiments and sauces in moderation

Plan meals that incorporate vegetables as the main dish (together with fruits, they should make up 50% of your plate), rather than meat or carbohydrates as part of a balanced diet.

2. **Employee Benefits/Private Medical Insurance (PMI)**: If applicable, you can utilize your employee benefits or private medical insurance to cover a portion of your outpatient bill.

By leveraging these financial resources and support systems, you can effectively manage and cover your outpatient bills related to diabetes."
,"Remember that the person with diabetes is responsible for managing it, not you. Living with diabetes can be difficult. By having the positive support of family and friends, they are better able to make the best possible choices about their diabetes.

Sometimes less can be more. Know when to give your loved ones the space to reflect on their own, and make mistakes. Be sensitive if they are experiencing any diabetes distress or burnout from managing it. Learn what the signs are, and gently encourage them to seek help instead of blaming or scolding them for poor management.

Avoiding HbA1c for screening and diagnosis of diabetes during pregnancy

Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) should not be used to screen for or diagnose diabetes during pregnancy. It is not sensitive in detecting postprandial hyperglycaemia and is generally lower during pregnancy because of increased red blood cell turnover. Screening for diabetes during pregnancy with HbA1c has also not been validated locally.

Post-pregnancy

Follow up women with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy

Usually, plasma glucose reverts to pre-pregnancy levels six weeks after delivery. It is recommended that women whose diabetes was diagnosed during pregnancy and pre-diabetes) be tested with 2-point (fasting and two-hour) 75 g OGTT between 6 to 12 weeks after delivery, to assess glycaemic status using non-pregnancy thresholds.20

(including diabetes, GDM,

Women with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy who are found to have normal glycaemic status at 6 to 12 weeks after delivery should be regularly screened for diabetes every 1 to 3 years (ideally annually) from then on.1

Women with a history of GDM are about 10 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) than women who had a normoglycaemic pregnancy.7 In Singapore, it is estimated that 4 in 10 women with a history of GDM develop T2DM or pre-diabetes within 4 to 6 years from delivery.21,22 Among women with a history of GDM, more frequent follow-up may be insulin during required for factors pregnancy or those with other risk developing diabetes such as non-pregnancy BMI ≥23 kg/m2 or a family history of diabetes.1,22

It is characterized by high blood sugar levels that can pose risks to both the mother and the baby. Gestational diabetes is usually diagnosed through screening tests during pregnancy. According to the articles provided, the diagnosis of gestational diabetes involves screening all women at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation using a 3-point 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Additionally, women at increased risk of pre-existing diabetes are recommended to be screened for diabetes during their first trimester using non-pregnancy glucose thresholds. If the results are normal, these women should be re-evaluated for gestational diabetes at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation."

Key messages

1

During their first trimester, screen for pre-existing diabetes in women at increased risk of it using non-pregnancy glucose thresholds. If results are normal, re-evaluate women for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.

2

At 24 to 28 weeks of gestation, screen all women for GDM using 3-point 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) unless they have already been diagnosed with diabetes or pre-diabetes.

3

At 6 to 12 weeks after delivery, reassess glycaemic status in women with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy using 2-point 75 g OGTT. If results are normal, screen women with a history of diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy for diabetes every 1 to 3 years (ideally annually) from then on.

Managing GDM to improve outcomes

Women with diabetes during pregnancy (defined as glucose including diabetes, GDM, and pre-diabetes) are at increased risk of maternal and neonatal complications (such as pre- eclampsia, macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia) compared to those without diabetes.1 When diabetes is this may represent undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes.

First trimester

Screen for undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes in women at increased risk

Before conception or during the first prenatal visit (first trimester), it is recommended to screen for pre-existing diabetes in women at increased risk of it using non-pregnancy thresholds.1

Women are considered to be at increased risk of pre- existing diabetes if any risk factor is present, such as:

– Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) ≥ 23 kg/m2 – History of GDM (or delivered a baby ≥ 4 kg) – History of polycystic ovary syndrome – History of pre-diabetes – Age ≥ 40 years – Family history of diabetes (first degree relative) – Hypertension

If results are normal, re-evaluate women for GDM at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.

While all women with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy timely management (including lifestyle intervention), those with pre-existing diabetes are at higher risk of poor diabetes outcomes than those with GDM. Hence, women with pre-existing diabetes require more stringent measures to reduce their risk of diabetes complications, including tighter glycaemic control and screening for complications (such as eye checks).1,7

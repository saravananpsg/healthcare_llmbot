{"user_query": "what are the side effects of using insulin injection ?", "answer": "The side effects of using insulin injections may include low blood sugar, initial weight gain, lumpy or scarred tissue from repeated injections in the same area of the body, and rashes at the injection site or, in rare cases, all over the body. It's important to be aware of these potential side effects and consult with your healthcare provider if you experience any concerning symptoms while using insulin injections.", "source_docs": [{"source_doc": "A 0.3ml syringe should be used for doses up to 30 units. A 0.5ml syringe should be used for doses up to 50 units. A 1ml syringe can be used for doses up to 100 units. Disposable syringes can be used for the same person up to about two to four times. Between uses, replace the cap and put the syringe in the fridge.\n\n\nInsulin PensInsulin pens combine both the needle and insulin cartridge into one. Thus, insulin injections become more convenient and you do not have to carry syringes and insulin bottles with you.\u00a0\n\n\nInsulin PumpsThe insulin pump is a small computerised device that pumps insulin continuously through a fine plastic tube into a site under the skin 24 hours a day. It is just a little larger than a pocket pager.\n\nPump users have to monitor their blood sugar frequently so as to make adjustments to the amount of insulin delivered. The insulin pump generally gives you better control and more meal flexibility, but is costlier and requires more frequent blood sugar monitoring.\n\nSwitching to Insulin from Anti-diabetes TabletsPatients who are switched to insulin from anti-diabetes tablets often worry that their condition must be deteriorating. However, the switch to insulin was made because the diabetes was getting out of control as the tablets were failing to control the patient\u2019s blood sugar \u2014 and the insulin will correct that.\n\nInsulin Side Effects\u00a0Taking insulin may result in some side effects.

Healthy Eating When You Have Diabetes

Diet is an important part of diabetes management. Eating well not only helps with your diabetes control, but also with weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and general health.

Healthy eating is recommended for everyone, including individuals with diabetes. All individuals can enjoy the same healthy meals.

Read on for a general guide on how you can make healthy food choices and have a balanced diet. For nutritional advice personalised to your condition and needs, do speak to a healthcare professional such as a dietitian.

While protein and fat may not have a direct impact on blood sugar levels, eating too much protein and fat can lead to weight gain which will increase insulin resistance and make diabetes control more difficult.

The type and amount of fat consumed is important. Mono- and poly- unsaturated fats are better for you. We should limit our intake of saturated and trans fats (e.g., found in fried chicken and baked products) to reduce our risk of cardiovascular disease.",https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/70e56617c5b140139bb5cb37db3cdef0?v=a7dd48f7&_gl=1*11zfakr*_ga*MTk3Mjg0Mjc5Ni4xNzA3Nzg5OTUw*_ga_VQW1KL2RMR*MTcxMDc1MzAxMS40LjEuMTcxMDc1NDQzMC42MC4wLjA.,0.894188722,"Some healthy eating tips for people with diabetes include:
1. Focusing on a balanced diet that includes whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables.
2. Limiting the intake of saturated and trans fats to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
3. Choosing healthier cooking methods like steaming, baking, boiling, or grilling.
4. Using natural seasonings instead of salt and opting for healthier cooking oils like sunflower, olive, or canola.
5. Planning meals that incorporate vegetables as the main dish and making them 50% of your plate.
6. Opting for healthier ingredients and whole grains over refined grains.
7. Removing visible fat from meat before cooking.
8. Consulting with a healthcare professional, such as a dietitian, for personalized nutritional advice tailored to your condition and needs."
,"If your schedule does not allow you to take regular meals, do discuss with your healthcare team on a diabetic medication regimen that is more suited for your lifestyle.

If you are planning to substantially reduce the amount of carbohydrates in your meals, you may be at risk of hypoglycaemia if you are on insulin or certain oral medications (sulfonylureas such as glipizide, gliclazide, glimepiride, tolbutamide). Do discuss with your doctor on how your medication can be adjusted to match any change in your diet. 22

You can whip up delicious and healthy meals even if you have diabetes. Some tips on how you can do this:

Use healthier cooking methods (e.g., steaming, baking, boiling, grilling).

Use healthier ingredients

Choose wholegrains instead of refined grains. For example, replace white rice with brown rice

Choose lean meat and remove all visible fat before cooking

Reduce salt, instead use natural seasoning (e.g., herbs and spices) Use condiments and sauces in moderation

Plan meals that incorporate vegetables as the main dish (together with fruits, they should make up 50% of your plate), rather than meat or carbohydrates as part of a balanced diet.

,"Remember that the person with diabetes is responsible for managing it, not you. Living with diabetes can be difficult. By having the positive support of family and friends, they are better able to make the best possible choices about their diabetes.

Sometimes less can be more. Know when to give your loved ones the space to reflect on their own, and make mistakes. Be sensitive if they are experiencing any diabetes distress or burnout from managing it. Learn what the signs are, and gently encourage them to seek help instead of blaming or scolding them for poor management.

Avoiding HbA1c for screening and diagnosis of diabetes during pregnancy

Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) should not be used to screen for or diagnose diabetes during pregnancy. It is not sensitive in detecting postprandial hyperglycaemia and is generally lower during pregnancy because of increased red blood cell turnover. Screening for diabetes during pregnancy with HbA1c has also not been validated locally.

Post-pregnancy

Follow up women with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy

Usually, plasma glucose reverts to pre-pregnancy levels six weeks after delivery. It is recommended that women whose diabetes was diagnosed during pregnancy and pre-diabetes) be tested with 2-point (fasting and two-hour) 75 g OGTT between 6 to 12 weeks after delivery, to assess glycaemic status using non-pregnancy thresholds.20

(including diabetes, GDM,

Women with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy who are found to have normal glycaemic status at 6 to 12 weeks after delivery should be regularly screened for diabetes every 1 to 3 years (ideally annually) from then on.1

Women with a history of GDM are about 10 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) than women who had a normoglycaemic pregnancy.7 In Singapore, it is estimated that 4 in 10 women with a history of GDM develop T2DM or pre-diabetes within 4 to 6 years from delivery.21,22 Among women with a history of GDM, more frequent follow-up may be insulin during required for factors pregnancy or those with other risk developing diabetes such as non-pregnancy BMI ≥23 kg/m2 or a family history of diabetes.1,22

It is characterized by high blood sugar levels that can pose risks to both the mother and the baby. Gestational diabetes is usually diagnosed through screening tests during pregnancy. According to the articles provided, the diagnosis of gestational diabetes involves screening all women at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation using a 3-point 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Additionally, women at increased risk of pre-existing diabetes are recommended to be screened for diabetes during their first trimester using non-pregnancy glucose thresholds. If the results are normal, these women should be re-evaluated for gestational diabetes at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation."

During their first trimester, screen for pre-existing diabetes in women at increased risk of it using non-pregnancy glucose thresholds. If results are normal, re-evaluate women for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.

2

At 24 to 28 weeks of gestation, screen all women for GDM using 3-point 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) unless they have already been diagnosed with diabetes or pre-diabetes.

3

At 6 to 12 weeks after delivery, reassess glycaemic status in women with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy using 2-point 75 g OGTT. If results are normal, screen women with a history of diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy for diabetes every 1 to 3 years (ideally annually) from then on.

Managing GDM to improve outcomes

Women with diabetes during pregnancy (defined as glucose including diabetes, GDM, and pre-diabetes) are at increased risk of maternal and neonatal complications (such as pre- eclampsia, macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia) compared to those without diabetes.1 When diabetes is this may represent undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes.

First trimester

Screen for undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes in women at increased risk

Before conception or during the first prenatal visit (first trimester), it is recommended to screen for pre-existing diabetes in women at increased risk of it using non-pregnancy thresholds.1

Women are considered to be at increased risk of pre- existing diabetes if any risk factor is present, such as:

– Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) ≥ 23 kg/m2 – History of GDM (or delivered a baby ≥ 4 kg) – History of polycystic ovary syndrome – History of pre-diabetes – Age ≥ 40 years – Family history of diabetes (first degree relative) – Hypertension

If results are normal, re-evaluate women for GDM at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.

While all women with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy timely management (including lifestyle intervention), those with pre-existing diabetes are at higher risk of poor diabetes outcomes than those with GDM. Hence, women with pre-existing diabetes require more stringent measures to reduce their risk of diabetes complications, including tighter glycaemic control and screening for complications (such as eye checks).1,7

Smoking does great harm to blood circulation and increases the risk of many diseases. 

If you are diabetic, regular foot examinations are important to prevent foot and leg ulcers, and to ensure your feet are in good health. Your podiatrist will check for: • Any loss of sensation • The level of blood flow to the feet • Any changes in the shape of your foot to assess the development of pressure points 

All these will help detect changes in any foot condition, and will help ensure that early preventive treatment or management can be given to prevent wounds from occurring or getting worse.

This may result in the development of diabetic foot ulcers, diabetic foot infections, or deformity of the feet.Diabetic Foot Screening Early identification and intervention of those at risk of diabetic foot ulcers and other foot infections will prevent complications and reduce the number of amputations.A team of registered assistant nurses at polyclinics are specially trained to perform diabetic foot screening. They are able to:• Identify and screen diabetic foot symptoms • Reduce the risk of foot complications by providing education on proper foot care and good glycaemic (blood sugar level) control• Refer patients who are at risk to podiatrists for early interventionDiabetic Foot Care Regular care of your feet should minimise the risk of incurring diabetic complications with them. This is what you should do to look after them:• Check your feet and toes every day for cuts, sores, corns or blisters. If you cannot see the soles of your feet, use a mirror or ask someone to help you.• See your doctor immediately if you hurt your feet or if your foot changes colour or looks different.• Choose shoes that are comfortable and fit well, and always wear socks/stockings to protect your feet. Never go barefoot.• Check the inside of your shoes before wearing them to ensure the lining is smooth and there are no sharp edges or objects inside.• Wash your feet every day with water and mild soap — but do not soak them; check that the water is not too hot to prevent scalding. Protect your feet from extremely hot or cold temperatures.• Dry your feet carefully, especially in between the toes. To prevent dryness and cracks, apply moisturising skin lotion all over your feet, but not between your toes.• Keep the blood flowing to your feet; put your feet up when you are sitting. Wriggle your toes and flex your feet up and down",https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/diabetic_foot_ttsh,0.87788437,

General considerations for individuals with obesity Lower physical activity levels are prevalent in adults who are overweight and obese This is likely due to low exercise capacity and being easily fatigued​

Modifications:​

Start slow E.g., If you are starting a walking programme, start with leisure walking instead of brisk walking.

Take breaks in between E.g., Instead of doing 20 mins of physical activity continuously, aim for 2 x 10 mins with a break in between.

Progress gradually Monitor your overall energy and fatigue levels during and the day after exercise.​ Ensure that you do not feel excessively fatigued, such that you can't carry out your normal daily routine.

Benefits of being physically active for individuals with Diabetes and Coronary Heart Disease

Exercising and participating in physical activity:

Improves glucose utilisation and insulin sensitivity​ • Controls weight ​ • Improves fitness​ • Reduces your risk of a cardiac event​ • Increases your chances of surviving a cardiac event

Impaired glucose control and being sedentary are major risk factors of coronary heart disease. Increasing your participation in physical activity and exercising is a modifiable factor that you can work on.

Precautions – what to look out for

Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY if you experience one or more of the following symptoms before, during or after exercising:​",https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/70e56617c5b140139bb5cb37db3cdef0?v=a7dd48f7&_gl=1*11zfakr*_ga*MTk3Mjg0Mjc5Ni4xNzA3Nzg5OTUw*_ga_VQW1KL2RMR*MTcxMDc1MzAxMS40LjEuMTcxMDc1NDQzMC42MC4wLjA.,0.855374437,"The recommended exercises for a person with diabetes include a combination of aerobic exercises, strength training, and flexibility exercises. Aerobic exercises such as brisk walking, cycling, swimming, or jogging help improve cardiovascular health, control weight, and enhance insulin sensitivity. Strength training exercises, like lifting weights or using resistance bands, can help build muscle mass and improve overall metabolism. Flexibility exercises, such as yoga or stretching, can improve mobility and reduce the risk of injuries. It is important for individuals with diabetes to engage in physical activities that they enjoy and can sustain in the long term to reap the benefits of regular exercise."
,"Note: If you are on insulin and sulphonylureas, it is best to consult a physiotherapist for a guided exercise session before determining the appropriate blood sugar levels for exercise, as there are many other factors to consider.

Increased physical activity







Perform at least 150 minutes of moderate- intensity exercise (such as brisk walking, leisure cycling), or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise (such as jogging, fast-paced cycling, swimming laps) every week. Avoid more than two consecutive days without exercise. Engage in exercises that require intensity and that accelerate the heart rate.

what are the side effects of using insulin injection ?,"A 0.3ml syringe should be used for doses up to 30 units. A 0.5ml syringe should be used for doses up to 50 units. A 1ml syringe can be used for doses up to 100 units. Disposable syringes can be used for the same person up to about two to four times. Between uses, replace the cap and put the syringe in the fridge.


Insulin PensInsulin pens combine both the needle and insulin cartridge into one. Thus, insulin injections become more convenient and you do not have to carry syringes and insulin bottles with you. 


Insulin PumpsThe insulin pump is a small computerised device that pumps insulin continuously through a fine plastic tube into a site under the skin 24 hours a day. It is just a little larger than a pocket pager.

Pump users have to monitor their blood sugar frequently so as to make adjustments to the amount of insulin delivered. The insulin pump generally gives you better control and more meal flexibility, but is costlier and requires more frequent blood sugar monitoring.

Switching to Insulin from Anti-diabetes TabletsPatients who are switched to insulin from anti-diabetes tablets often worry that their condition must be deteriorating. However, the switch to insulin was made because the diabetes was getting out of control as the tablets were failing to control the patient’s blood sugar — and the insulin will correct that.

Insulin Side Effects Taking insulin may result in some side effects. These include: • Low blood sugar • Initial weight gain  • Lumpy or scarred tissue from too many injections on the same part of the body • Rashes on the injection site or, in rare cases, all over the body

Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus: TabletsTreatment of type 2 diabetes begins with diet control. If diet alone is unable to control blood sugar levels, then tablets have to be taken. If both diet and tablets fail to control the blood sugar levels, insulin injections may be needed.

Oral anti-diabetes tablets are used for treating type 2 diabetes.

Sulphonylureas e.g. - Chlorpropamide (Diabinese®) - Glibenclamide (Daonil®) - Gliclazide (Diamicron®) - Tolbutamide (Rastinon®) - Glimepiride (Amaryl®) 
Help the pancreas to release more insulin and the body to use glucose more effectively.

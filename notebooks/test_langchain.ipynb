It is important to also screen for pre-existing diabetes in the first trimester and after delivery, as women with a history of GDM are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on in life.', 'result': ' Gestational diabetes is diabetes that is diagnosed during pregnancy, usually in the second or third trimester. It is characterized by high blood sugar levels that may be caused by decreased insulin sensitivity or underlying beta-cell dysfunction. Gestational diabetes is usually identified through a 3-point 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation, unless the woman has already been diagnosed with diabetes or pre-diabetes. It is important to regularly monitor and manage gestational diabetes, as it can increase the risk of complications for both the mother and baby.'}, {'question': 'What are some healthy eating tips for people with diabetes?', 'answer': 'Some healthy eating tips for people with diabetes include:\\n\\n1. Focus on a balanced diet that includes carbohydrates, protein, and fats, with an emphasis on managing carbohydrate intake to control blood sugar levels.\\n2. Choose healthier cooking methods like steaming, baking, boiling, or grilling to prepare meals.\\n3. Opt for whole grains over refined grains, such as replacing white rice with brown rice.\\n4. Select lean meats and remove visible fats before cooking to reduce saturated fat intake.\\n5. Use natural seasonings like herbs and spices instead of excessive salt.\\n6. Incorporate vegetables and fruits as the main components of your meals, making up at least 50% of your plate.\\n7. Stay hydrated with water as your primary drink choice and avoid sugary beverages.\\n8. Plan meals ahead, make a shopping list, and opt for healthier products during festivals and celebrations to maintain healthy eating habits.\\n9.

Choose carbohydrates wisely - opt for complex carbohydrates that are high in fiber like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\\n2. Incorporate lean protein into your meals - this can help with weight control and keeping blood sugar levels stable.\\n3.

Fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables - make these foods the main part of your meal.\\n5. Use healthier cooking methods - opt for methods like steaming, baking, or grilling instead of frying.\\n6. Watch your portions - portion control is important in managing blood sugar levels and maintaining a healthy weight.\\n7.

    "     'answer': 'Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy and usually goes away after delivery. It is diagnosed using a 3-point 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation, unless the woman has already been diagnosed with diabetes or pre-diabetes. It is important to also screen for pre-existing diabetes in the first trimester and after delivery, as women with a history of GDM are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on in life.'\n",

    "    'question': \"How can my outpatient bill for diabetes be covered?\",\n",
    "    'answer': \"Your outpatient bill for diabetes can be covered through various means, including government subsidies, employee benefits/private medical insurance, and the use of MediSave through the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP). The bill can be further offset with government subsidies available at public specialist outpatient clinics, polyclinics, and through schemes like the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), Pioneer Generation (PG), and Merdeka Generation (MG) outpatient subsidies. Additionally, patients can tap on accounts of immediate family members for MediSave, and those aged 60 and above can use MediSave for the 15% co-payment under CDMP.\"\n",

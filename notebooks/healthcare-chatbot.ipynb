      "Answer: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It is characterized by high blood sugar levels that can pose risks to both the mother and the baby. GDM is diagnosed through screening tests conducted during pregnancy, typically between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. The screening involves a 3-point 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for all pregnant women, unless they have already been diagnosed with diabetes or pre-diabetes. Women at increased risk of pre-existing diabetes are also screened for diabetes during their first trimester using non-pregnancy glucose thresholds. If the results are normal, they are re-evaluated for GDM later in the pregnancy. After delivery, women with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy are recommended to undergo a 2-point 75 g OGTT between 6 to 12 weeks post-delivery to assess their glycaemic status. Regular screening for diabetes is advised for these women every 1 to 3 years, ideally annually, to monitor their health status and reduce the risk of developing complications.\n"

      "1. **Balanced Diet**: Fill your plate with a quarter of whole grains, a quarter of good sources of protein, and half with fruits and vegetables to maintain a healthy balanced diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Limit Carbohydrates**: Be mindful of your carbohydrate intake as they have the greatest impact on blood sugar levels. Opt for whole grains over refined grains and include carbohydrates as part of a healthy eating plan.\n",

      "3. **Healthy Cooking Methods**: Use healthier cooking methods such as steaming, baking, boiling, or grilling to prepare your meals.\n",

      "4. **Choose Lean Proteins**: Opt for lean meats and remove visible fat before cooking to reduce saturated fat intake.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Reduce Salt**: Use natural seasonings like herbs and spices instead of salt to flavor your dishes.\n",

      "6. **Stay Hydrated**: Keep a bottle of water handy to stay hydrated and avoid sugary drinks that can impact blood sugar levels.\n",

      "7. **Plan Meals**: Plan your meals in advance, incorporating vegetables as the main dish and fruits to make up at least 50% of your plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Moderate Alcohol**: Limit alcohol consumption as it provides empty calories and can lead to hypoglycemia if consumed excessively.\n",

The bill can be further offset with government subsidies available at public specialist outpatient clinics, polyclinics, and through schemes like the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), Pioneer Generation (PG), and Merdeka Generation (MG) outpatient subsidies. Additionally, patients can tap on accounts of immediate family members for MediSave, and those aged 60 and above can use MediSave for the 15% co-payment under CDMP.\"\n",

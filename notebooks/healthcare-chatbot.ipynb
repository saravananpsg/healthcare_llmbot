It is characterized by high blood sugar levels that can pose risks to both the mother and the baby. GDM is diagnosed through screening tests conducted during pregnancy, typically between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. The screening process involves a 3-point 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for all pregnant women, unless they have already been diagnosed with diabetes or pre-diabetes. Women at increased risk of pre-existing diabetes are also screened for diabetes during their first trimester using non-pregnancy glucose thresholds.
